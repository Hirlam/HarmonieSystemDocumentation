Because of inaccurate forward modelling, large background errors in cloud fields, and non-linear effects, success in the use of IASI requires careful screening and removal of cloud-affected data. In the HARMONIE data assimilation system, the screening for cloud follows the method of McNally and Watts (2003). The power of this method lies in the use of a large number of individual channels such that much of the disturbing instrument noise can be smoothed out and the cloud radiative effect is therefore more easily detected.","category":"page"},{"location":"Observations/Iasi/","page":"IASI","title":"IASI","text":"Even if the active use of IASI is limited to relatively small number of channels (such as the 55-channel subset in MetCoOp in early 2021), it is advisable to include more than 100 channels in the cloud detection channel list. Furthermore, it is important that all these channels are subjected to VarBC. To achieve the latter, one needs to make sure that blacklisting for the cloud detection channels uses the fail(EXPERIMENTAL) syntax rather than fail(CONSTANT).

In step 2 you then use the statistics derived in step 1 to generate the final background error statistics files by applying ensemble data assimilation within the HARMONIE-AROME modelling system.","category":"page"},{"location":"DataAssimilation/StructureFunctions/","page":"Structure functions","title":"Structure functions","text":"In step 1 structure functions are generated from difference fields from ensemble members of HARMONIE-AROME forecast. These are obtained from downscaling of ECMWF EDA ensemble forecast. To alleviate spin-up issues, these phase 1 downscaled HARMONIE-AROME forecasts are run up to 6 hours, and differences are generated from these. Using the ECMWF LBC data, 6h HARMONIE ensemble forecasts are initiated from ECMWF 6h forecasts daily from 00 UTC and 12 UTC, with ECMWF forecasts as initial and lateral boundary conditions. To obtain stable statistics, it is recomended to run 4 ensembles for two chosen one-month episode (s). The episodes should sample different seasons.  Therefore it is recommended to run for one winter month and one summer month, for example June 2016 and January 2017. These periods are chosen so as to benefit from the latest upgrade to ECMWF's EDA system. Thereby we sample both seasonal (January, July)  and daily (00 UTC and 12 UTC) variations. After running of the ensembles the archived results (6h forecasts) are processed to generate structure functions by running a program called 'festat'. Festat will be run automatically within the SMS system when DTGEND is approached by an experiment and the statistics will be based on difference files generated by intermediate program femars and stored on ecfs in ec:/$uid/harmonie/$exp/femars (software to generate binary GRIB files of forecasts differences after each cycle). This will mean that if you start by running a one month experiment for January the structure functions generated when you reach DTGEND will be for January. When you use the same experiment name and launch also an experiment for July you will when you reach DTGEND have background error statistics based on both January and July differences files (since both of those are now found in ec:/$uid/harmonie/$exp/femars). These combined winter/summer background error statistics files from phase one are final product from step 1 and can are the intermediate background error statistics files to plug into the HARMONIE-AROME data assimilation of step 2. It should be mentioned that there is a possibility for the more advanced user to run festat off-line and with any combinations of January-July forecast difference files from ec:/$uid/harmonie/$exp/femars.

You use the background error statistics from phase 1 and do the eda within a data assimilation cycle. This has the important advantage that you significantly reduce spinup caused by the HARMONIE-AROME model adjustments to ECMWF EDA starting initial states.

The conclusion is that there are both pros and cons with BRAND as compared with EDA. The main conclusion is that both EDAand BRAND are hampered by the homogeneity and isotrophy assumptions in 3DVAR/4DVAR framework, so that differences are smaller than in hybrid DA frameworks. Therefore continued EDA/BRAND comparisons are carried out withing hybrid ensemble/da frameworks.

Note that if time steps are not converted in order the time axis will not be consecutive. For non-instantaneous fields a time bounds variable is added. The start of the interval is taken from fstart (from tri=2) or outkey%F0, or just from the input file (usually 0). The end of the interval is the current time step. Whether the time variables refers to the beginning, middle or end of the interval can be controlled with the ctimeis namelist variable.

With the namelist variable cdatefname you can write output from multiple cycles to the same file.

Be careful with the first time step of a cycle when using cdatefname as gl will overwrite the last time step of the previous cycle with those of the first step of the new cycle.

NODE.001_01 and lola in your output directory.\nHow to I handle the output files? The output files are of the form Out.XXX.XXXX and appear in your output directory. There are in lfa format and can be handled using ddh tools. See the bash script musc_plot1Dts.sh for ideas. There are also ICM*lfa output files that are also handy for plotting profiles - use musc_convertICM2ascii.sh to convert these files to ASCII and musc_plot_profiles_ICMfiles.sh to plot some profiles e.g. TKE, cloud liquid etc.\nI ran a different idealised case but did not get different results? The likely reason for this is that you did not delete the namelists from your experiment directory. If the namelists are there, the musc_run.sh script neither creates them nor copies them from the repository.\nHow do I create a new idealised case? This is not straightforward but the following was used to create the ASTEX cases in cy43 using info from cy38: https://www.overleaf.com/7513443985ckqvfdcphnng\nHow can I access a list of MUSC output parameters? Ensure you have the ddhtoolbox compiled. Then use lfaminm $file on any of your output files and it will show what is there. To look at a particular variable try lfac $file $parameter e.g. lfac $file PTS (for surface temperature). You can use cat to copy the values to an ASCII file for ease of use (e.g. lfac $file PTS > $ASCIIfile).  \nIs MUSC similar to the full 3D model version - is the physics the same? Yes, if you checkout develop then you have MUSC up-to-date with that.\nDo I need to recompile the model if I modify code? Yes, if you modify code in a single file you must recompile the code but do not delete the original compiled model first. This will recompile relatively quickly. If you modify code in multiple files and you change what variables are passed between files, then you must delete your original compiled model and recompile the code. This will take longer to recompile.

This is so in order to avoid conflicts between the previous and the new utilities. If the user wants the previous method just activate LECHKEVO and make sure not to activate LNWECHKEVO.","category":"page"},{"location":"DataAssimilation/NWECHKEVO/#Important-Info","page":"NWECHKEVO","title":"Important Info","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"DataAssimilation/NWECHKEVO/","page":"NWECHKEVO","title":"NWECHKEVO","text":"NWECHKEVO speeds up the generation of diagnostics by minimizing MPI overhead.

Therefore, when running with a small number of MPI-tasks it is possible that some of the points in NAMCHK are ignored. This situation however is very unlikely because the usual number of MPI-tasks is quite big.

In this case, a dependency is added as a simple string to the dependencies section, for example:\n\"dependencies\":[\"OpenMP\", \"LAPACK\"]\nThis option is for packages like OpenMP which do not involve finding libraries located in unusual places as often happens when using environment modules.\nYou can still rely on CMake to find the package, but provide a bit of detail on how to find it. In this case a dependency is added as a JSON object of the following form (using the NetCDF library as an example):\n{\n  \"pkg\":\"NetCDF\",\n  \"use_cmake_config\":false,\n  \"components\":[\"C\",\"Fortran\"],\n  \"hints\":[\"$ENV{NETCDF_DIR}\",\"$ENV{NETCDF_F_DIR}\"],\n  \"cmake\":{\"NETCDF_USE_DEFAULT_PATHS\":true}\n}\nThere the use_cmake_config field tells CMake which mechanism it should use to find the library in question. When use_cmake_config is set to true CMake will look for CMake configuration files installed with the library, which is a recommended option in modern CMake. Even though it's a recommended by the CMake authors option, not all the libraries provide CMake configuration files so just setting use_cmake_config to true does not work all the time (at least it works for the auxiliary libraries compiled with CMake). You might want to provide a -D<package name>_DIR=<path to CMake config files> as an argument to the cmake command when configuring the build if CMake fails to find a package.\nAnother alternative is setting use_cmake_config to false, then CMake will try to find the required dependency using the hand-written scripts provided by the authors of CMake (or found under the util/cmake directory of HARMONIE-AROME). These scripts usually do quite some work trying to find a dependency and sometimes fail even if library is there, for example when it's located in a very unusual place or has an unexpected pkg-config name.\nWhen using \"use_cmake_config\":false one may add a components list, if only a language-specific version of the dependency is wanted. For example, having:\n{\"pkg\":\"NetCDF\", \"use_cmake_config\":false, \"components\":[\"C\"]}\nCMake would not try to find the Fortran version of NetCDF library, which can be useful sometimes. Use this option of defining external dependencies for such libraries as MPI, which can have multiple vendors and subtle differences between libraries provided (for example CMake should be able to figure out the correct MPI libraries for both MPICH and Open-MPI).\nThe hints list tells CMake which directories it should check when looking for a library.\nnote: Note\nElements of the hints list are simply added to the <PackageName>_ROOT CMake variable. If CMake's find_package(<PackageName>) does not use this variable providing hints would have no effect.\nFinally, the cmake section provides a key-value set of elements, which will be converted to corresponding CMake variables set before calling find_package(<PackageName>). Thus, it can be used to control the behaviour of find_package.\nnote: Note\nVariables set in the cmake section are local to the current package and do not modify the global scope.\nWhen nothing of the above works, you can provide all the flags manually. To do so, use the following form for a dependency entry:\n{\n  \"pkg\":\"HDF5\",\n  \"raw_lib\":{\n    \"include\":\"$ENV{HDF5_DIR}/include\",\n    \"lib_directory\":\"$ENV{HDF5_DIR}/lib\",\n    \"lib\":[\"-lhdf5hl_fortran\", \"-lhdf5_fortran\", \"-lhdf5_hl\", \"-lhdf5\"]\n  }\n}\nwhere the raw_lib component provides all the needed include and link directories as well as the link libraries. If some some fields of the raw_lib object are unneeded they can be set to null:\n{\"pkg\":\"rt\", \"raw_lib\":{\"include\":null, \"lib_directory\":null, \"lib\":\"-lrt\"}}\nNote that all the members of the raw_lib object can be defined as lists:\n{\n  \"pkg\":\"HDF5\",\n  \"raw_lib\":{\n    \"include\":[\"$ENV{HDF5_DIR}/include\",\"$ENV{HDF5_DIR}/include_fortran\"],\n    \"lib_directory\":[\"$ENV{HDF5_DIR}/lib\",\"$ENV{HDF5_DIR}/lib64\"],\n    \"lib\":[\"-lhdf5hl_fortran\", \"-lhdf5_fortran\", \"-lhdf5_hl\", \"-lhdf5\"]\n  }\n}\nWhen providing the required libraries in the lib section one can skip the -l prefix, thus having \"lib\":\"-lrt\" and \"lib\":\"rt\" would have the same effect.\nSometimes it can be useful to define a dummy library in CMake without actually looking for the library files, for example when compiling a tool which uses only a subset of HARMONIE-AROME libraries. When loading HARMONIE-AROME as a CMake package all the targets associated with external dependencies should be present, but some of these dependencies might be not needed for successful linking (or these are added implicitly by the programming environment and adding them for the second time in CMake won't make any difference).

CMake matches this field against the names of its targets, which means that having, for example, \"project\":\"surf\" would apply the compilation flags for all CMake targets named surf or with names starting with surf-, as in surf-module. When CMake finds a suitable project-specific section it will append project-specific compilation flags to the global compilation flags for the project in question (if not explicitly asked to not use global flags). If there's no suitable section with project-specific options, only the global options will be used.\nnote: Note\nAll compilation flags and preprocessor definitions should be set via JSON config and not through the native CMake variables.\nflags_fortran define compiler flags to be used when compiling Fortran source files.

Providing the compiler flags as a JSON object allows for a fine-grained control applying different flags for different build configurations (the first two forms will apply the same flags for any build configuration). This object contains three subsections: any, debug and release. Compiler flags put under the any section will be used for any build type, while flags under debug and release will be used only when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is set to Debug or Release, respectively. Thus if having, for example, \"flags_fortran\":{\"any\":[\"-std=f2003\"], \"debug\":[\"-O0\"], \"release\":[\"-O2\"]} Fortran sources will be compiled using -std=f2003 -O0 when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug and -std=f2003 -O2 when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release.\nnote: Note\nTechnically, the compiler flags there are not limited to the debug and release configurations.

However, this feature is not used in the current version of CMake-based build system for HARMONIE-AROME\nnote: Note\nCompiler flags there can be provided as a list (e.g., [\"-Wall\", \"-Wextra\"]) or as a plain string when there is only a single flag (e.g., \"flags_fortran\":\"-O2\") but never as a space-separated string with multiple compiler flags.

In some situations it can be useful to ignore the global compilation flags defined by \"project\":null and use only project-specific flags or preprocessor definitions.

This is a default generator for CMake running on Linux and it usually works pretty well. However, when building with Unix Makefiles, CMake relies on its own Fortran parsers to scan the source tree and determine the build dependencies. Thus, in some rare cases of heavy CPP usage in Fortran code CMake can get inter-module dependencies wrong. The Unix Makefiles build is not parallel by default but it can be controlled, as with any conventional makefile-based build, by passing the desired -j flags to make. Additionally, when invoking the build via cmake --build command, a -j (or --parallel) flag can be used for setting the number of parallel jobs in a build-system-agnostic way, see CMake documentation.\nNinja is a modern alternative to Make. Ninja is built with focus on speed and Ninja build is parallel by default, however, unlike Make, the build files for Ninja are very cumbersome to hand-write and they are usually machine-generated. When building Fortran code with CMake Ninja generator, an explicit preprocessing step is added, thus the inter-module dependencies should be always correct (or at least these corner cases where Unix Makefiles struggles to get correct dependencies are handled correctly by Ninja). In some cases using Ninja generator can reduce the build time due to better parallelization of the build, however since Ninja has a separate preprocessing step, it generates more output and, if the file system is a bottleneck, Ninja build can be slower than Unix Makefiles build.

BATOR is also software developed at Météo France to generate the ODB (Observational !DataBase) database for the ARPEGE/ALADIN/HARMONIE analysis system. ODB is a tailor made database software developed at ECMWF to manage very large observational data volumes assimilated in the IFS 4DVAR system, and to enable flexible post-processing of this data. We use oulan to generate an OBSOUL file from different BUFR files (note you can easily change the oulan program to handle data in different format than BUFR. For example in OPLACE data processing some files are in netCDF format). OBSOUL file is an ASCII formatted file, the content of which is similar to that of the CMA (Central Memory Array, packing format actually in use in the HIRLAM data assimilation system). Our version of ouland is placed under “util” directory in the repository. HARMONIE BATOR originates from the MF export-pack. The figure bellow describes the mechanism of the observation pre-processing in HARMONIE DA.
