Because of inaccurate forward modelling, large background errors in cloud fields, and non-linear effects, success in the use of IASI requires careful screening and removal of cloud-affected data. In the HARMONIE data assimilation system, the screening for cloud follows the method of McNally and Watts (2003). The power of this method lies in the use of a large number of individual channels such that much of the disturbing instrument noise can be smoothed out and the cloud radiative effect is therefore more easily detected.","category":"page"},{"location":"Observations/Iasi/#","page":"IASI","title":"IASI","text":"Even if the active use of IASI is limited to relatively small number of channels (such as the 55-channel subset in MetCoOp in early 2021), it is advisable to include more than 100 channels in the cloud detection channel list.

To achieve the latter, one needs to make sure that blacklisting for the cloud detection channels uses the fail(EXPERIMENTAL) syntax rather than fail(CONSTANT).

Within the HARMONIE community the derivation has been based on data generated with ensemble HARMONIE forecasts which downscale from ECMWF EPS runs. To alleviate spin-up issues the HARMONIE  forecasts are run up to 6 hours. Using the ECMWF LBC data, 6h HARMONIE ensemble forecasts are initiated from ECMWF 6h forecasts daily from 00 UTC and 12 UTC, with ECMWF forecasts as initial  and lateral boundary conditions. To obtain stable statistics, it seems appropriate to run 4 ensembles for the chosen episode (s). Ideally the episodes should sample different seasons.  Therefore it is recommended to run for one winter month and one summer month, for example June 2016 and January 2017. These periods are chosen so as to benefit from the latest upgrade to ECMWF's EDA syste,. Thereby we sample both seasonal (January, July)  and daily (00 UTC and 12 UTC)  variations.

To get an idea of what the correlations and covariances should look like take a look in the article: Berre, L., 2000: Estimation of synoptic and meso scale forecast error covariances in a limited area model. Mon. Wea. Rev., 128, 644-667. Software for investigating and graphically illustrate different aspects of the background error statistics has been developed and statistics generated for different domains has been investigated (see attached report below by Nils Gustafsson). With this software you can also compare your newly generated background error statistics with the one generated for other HARMONIE domains. This will give you and idea if your statistics seems reasonable. For diagnosing the newly derived background error statistics follow these instructions:\nGet the code and scripts:\n# on ecgate\ncd $SCRATCH\necp ec:/smx/Jb_wiki_ml/jbdiagconv_ensys.tar .\ntar -xvf jbdiagconv_ensys.tar # produces $SCRATCH/jbdiagconv\ncd jbdiagconv \nIn jbdiagconv you will find:\ndata (containing background error statistics for different domains\ndiagXXarome directories containing output-statistics for different domains (for example diagDKarome and  diagFIarome)\ntwo .f90 files - jbconv.f90  jbdiagnose.f90\nthree scripts for diagnostics - jbconv.sh, jbdiagnose.sh and ???\nCompile the fortran programs (with gfortran):\ncd $SCRATCH/jbdiagconv\n./Compile\nThe Compile script should produce two executables, jbdiagnose.x and  jbconv.x. \nNext, fetch your background error statistics files:\ncd $SCRATCH/jbdiagconv/data\necp ec:/$uid/jbdata/stab_your_exp_2012070106_240* .\ngunzip stab_your_exp_2012070106_240.*.gz\nRun Jb diagnostics script:\nmkdir ${SCRATCH}/jbdiaconv/diag # for output\n### edit 'jbdiagnose.ksh' to read your data and adjust namelist to your domain settings (horizontal resolution and vertical levels). \n### Finally generate statistics \n./jbdiagnose.ksh'\n### A lot of statistics files appears in directory ${SCRATCH}/jbdiagconv/diag\ncp -r ${SCRATCH}/jbdiagconv/diag ${SCRATCH}/jbdiagconv/diagEXP\nPlaced in ${SCRATCH}/jbdiagconv plot statistics of your newly derived background error statistics with ./plotbaloper_arome.sh, plotspdens_arome.sh and plotvercor.sh. This will generate a lot of postscript files in directory ${SCRATCH}/jbdiagconv. The statistics is for newly generated structure functions (named EXP) as well as for structure functions of other domains, plotted together. The meaning of these can be found in attached document by Gustafsson (missing?). Note that the plot scripts can be adjusted to plot different vertical levels instead of the currently chosen level.\nAnother way to diagnose the background error statistics is to investigate the analysis increments of various types of data assimilation experiments. For carrying out such experiments we however first need to introduce our newly generated background error statistics into a data assimilation experiment. That procedure is describe below for a full scale data assimilation experiment (utilizing in this example the domain placed over Denmark (named DKCOEXP), for which the statistics was derived).","category":"page"},{"location":"DataAssimilation/StructureFunctions/#Test-3DVAR-with-the-new-background-error-statistics-1","page":"Structure functions","title":"Test 3DVAR with the new background error statistics","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"DataAssimilation/StructureFunctions/#","page":"Structure functions","title":"Structure functions","text":"create hm_home/38h12_assim directory.

Then plot the difference between files file with your favourite software. Plot horizontal and vertical cross-sections of temperature and other variables using your favourite software (MetgraF or cross for example).\nNow you have managed to insert the newly generated background error statistics to the assimilation system and managed to carry out a full scale data assimilation system and plot the analysis increments. The next natural step to further diagnose the background error statistics is to carry out a single observation impact experiment, utilizing your newly generated background error statistics.

The purpose is to make it easier to get started and to carry out technical data assimilation tests for new domains.

One constraint worth mentioning is that the number of vertical levels of the two domains should be the same. In addition, wave number 1 in the spectral representation of errors should be larger for the input domain than for the output. In practice this mean that the length (in km) of the longest side of the domain should be longer for the input domin than for the output domain. By doing some settings in the HARMONIE system background error statistics can automatically be interpolated from one area to another in HARMONIE data assimilation experiments. This procedure is described below and it has been tested on HARMONIE cy38b1.1.beta1, from which version it is applicable.

Convert from FA-file format to GRIB with the gl-software ($SCRATCH/hm_home/38h12_jbint/bin/gl) by typing ./gl -p MXMIN1999+0000 and ./gl -p ICMSHHARM+0003. Then plot the difference between files file with your favourite software. Plot horizontal and vertical cross-sections of temperature and other variables using your favourite software (MetgraF or cross for example). The interpolated background error statistics for the MEDITERRANEAN domain will appear on cca in $SCRATCH/hm_home/38h12_jbint/lib/const/jb_data as stabfiltn_MEDITERRANEAN_65_jbconv.cv and stabfiltn_MEDITERRANEAN_65_jbconv.bal.","category":"page"},{"location":"DataAssimilation/StructureFunctions/#","page":"Structure functions","title":"Structure functions","text":"Note that you can change the area you want to interpolate the structure functions from by editing in the script jbconv.sh.","category":"page"},{"location":"DataAssimilation/StructureFunctions/#Recent-work-and-future-developments-1","page":"Structure functions","title":"Recent work & future developments","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"DataAssimilation/StructureFunctions/#","page":"Structure functions","title":"Structure functions","text":"Recent and on-going work as well as plans for future developments:","category":"page"},{"location":"DataAssimilation/StructureFunctions/#","page":"Structure functions","title":"Structure functions","text":"Present work regarding structure functions concerns investigations of spin-up effects related with downscaling of ECMWF Ensemble Data Assimilation (EDA) forecasts with the HARMONIE system.

NODE.001_01 and lola in your output directory.\nHow to I handle the output files? The output files are of the form Out.XXX.XXXX and appear in your output directory. There are in lfa format and can be handled using ddh tools. See the bash script muscplot1Dts.sh for ideas. There are also ICM*lfa output files that are also handy for plotting profiles - use muscconvertICM2ascii.sh to convert these files to ASCII and muscplotprofiles_ICMfiles.sh to plot some profiles e.g. TKE, cloud liquid etc.\nI ran a different idealised case but did not get different results? The likely reason for this is that you did not delete the namelists from your experiment directory. If the namelists are there, the musc_run.sh script neither creates them nor copies them from the repository.\nHow do I create a new idealised case? This is not straightforward but the following was used to create the ASTEX cases in cy43 using info from cy38: https://www.overleaf.com/7513443985ckqvfdcphnng\nHow can I access a list of MUSC output parameters? Ensure you have the ddhtoolbox compiled. Then use lfaminm file on any of your output files and it will show what is there. To look at a particular variable try lfac file parameter e.g. lfac file PTS (for surface temperature). You can use cat to copy the values to an ASCII file for ease of use (e.g. lfac file PTS > ASCIIfile).  \nIs MUSC similar to the full 3D model version - is the physics the same? Yes, if you checkout develop then you have MUSC up-to-date with that.\nDo I need to recompile the model if I modify code? Yes, if you modify code in a single file you must recompile the code but do not delete the original compiled model first. This will recompile relatively quickly. If you modify code in multiple files and you change what variables are passed between files, then you must delete your original compiled model and recompile the code. This will take longer to recompile.

The output of oulan (OBSOUL) is one of the inputs of BATOR. BATOR is also software developed at Météo France to generate the ODB (Observational !DataBase) database for the ARPEGE/ALADIN/HARMONIE analysis system. ODB is a tailor made database software developed at ECMWF to manage very large observational data volumes assimilated in the IFS 4DVAR system, and to enable flexible post-processing of this data (Sami Saarinen, 2006). We use oulan to generate an OBSOUL file from different BUFR files (note you can easily change the oulan program to handle data in different format than BUFR. For example in OPLACE data processing some files are in netCDF format). OBSOUL file is an ASCII formatted file, the content of which is similar to that of the CMA (Central Memory Array, packing format actually in use in the HIRLAM data assimilation system). Our version of ouland is placed under “util” directory in the repository. HARMONIE BATOR originates from the MF export-pack. The figure bellow describes the mechanism of the observation pre-processing in HARMONIE DA. To sum it up, !ShuffleBufr splits different observations into BUFR files, then oulan creates the OBSOUL file, and BATOR creates the ODB file using satellite BUFR/GRIB/BIN files and the OBSOUL one.\nCompilation: oulan, Shufflebufr are compiled using gmkpack or makeup.\nScripts: Oulan\nInput/output\noulan  input: BUFR files; output: the OBSOUL file in ASCII format","category":"page"},{"location":"Observations/Oulan/#ShuffleBufr-1","page":"Oulan","title":"ShuffleBufr","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"Observations/Oulan/#","page":"Oulan","title":"Oulan","text":"ShuffleBufr splits different observations into separate BUFR files according the IFS observation type/sub-type definition.

BATOR is also developed at Météo France to generate the ODB (Observational !DataBase) database for the ARPEGE/ALADIN/HARMONIE analysis system. ODB is a tailor made database software developed at ECMWF to manage very large observational data volumes assimilated in the IFS 4DVAR system, and to enable flexible post-processing of this data (Sami Saarinen, 2006). HARMONIE's BATOR originates from the MF export-pack. The figure below describes the mechanism of the observation pre-processing in HARMONIE DA.

To analyse scales up to 25 km deterministically over sea requires high density observations both in space and time, i.e., for the latter at least every hour.

This is necessary because odbi_shared.c is an include file (but not recognized by fcm as such - hence it's not in the inc directory and cannot be found without a full path).
